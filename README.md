#### Statement &#129313;

``
Zeus must face Hades, who wants to destroy the Greek island of Rhodes (a rhombus-shaped island).
Hades has hidden dragon eggs at different locations of the island, which can be represented as a 2D
matrix (grid). Zeus has sent Athena to discover the location of these dragon eggs using a board
(another 2D matrix). She must discover the eggs and destroy them before the dragons are born,
otherwise, they will destroy the island, killing all inhabitants in Rhodes.
